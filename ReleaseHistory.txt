Bug Fixed:
    1. (BHS_ReportViewer.exe) Overcome following reported Reporting Service bug by 
       using work arround 2 as per Microsoft's answer below:
       Posted Question to MS:
       "I was having trouble with printing and the print layout in the ReportViewer 
       control for WinForms. To reproduce this problem I created a simple form with 
       just a ReportViewer control on it. I set the Report Server URL and Report 
       Path at design-time and started the app. The report I was using had three 
       parameters: a DateTime (set to a default date), a multi-value list (also 
       set to a default of Select All) and another multi-value list with no default. 
       I left the first two parameters at their default values and set the third 
       parameter. I got the expected results. I printed the report and got the 
       same thing that was shown on the screen. I then changed the date and clicked 
       the View Report button. I again got the expected values on the screen. 
       However, when I printed it the report showed the same data as the previous 
       print out. I then switched to Print Layout and saw that the Print Layout 
       view had not updated. In addition, if I changed any of the parameters while 
       in Print Layout view, the report would not change unless I clicked the 
       refresh button (or if I went back to Normal view, but the Print Layout 
       still stayed the same.) Anyway, I went into this gory detail because I 
       wanted to see if anyone else had seen anything similar to this. I searched 
       these forums, but didn't find anything."
       Posted Answer from MS:
       "We are aware of this bug. You can work around the problem by (1) clicking 
       the refresh button on the toolbar after changing the parameters. You can 
       also work around it in code by (2) hooking up to the ViewButtonClick 
       event and calling RefreshReport."
